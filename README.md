# Welcome

## What is Manomite

Manomite is an endless possibilities to healthcare. Its a **centralized** planet, to **improve the quality of health** service delivery through a **technology driven solutions**, which create platform for interactions between the medical personnel, medical service provider, hospitals, clinics, care-givers and all other health institution across Africa.

Majorly Manomite focuses on **Telemedicine, Data Managements, Payments, Research, Connections and Healthcare Security.**

As a developer, you can leverage on most of Manomite powerful micro services into your EMR Applications or any inline healthcare applications.

To travel to Manomite Planet as a developer, you must have a Spaceship ðŸ˜œ Not really a NASA Spaceship. When I say Spaceship, it means you will need the Manomite Endpoint and your key to ship data or export data or use advanced tools using AI etc.

There is only one spaceship which serves every developer needs. Below is the endpoint.

```
https://spaceship.manomite.net
```

```
Connections are only allowed through secured environments.
```

Once you're **strong enough**, to drive the spaceship then you can commence to the next step.

What do I mean by the phrase **strong enough.** To be strong enough, you must make sure you have a secured development environment. If you are working from localhost, please install SSL on your local development machine to avoid being blocked  by the Manomite Spaceship Sentinels.
