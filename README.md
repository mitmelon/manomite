# Welcome

## What is Manomite

Manomite is an endless possibilities to healthcare. Its decentralized and interoperable system that **improves the quality of health** service delivery which create platform for interactions between the medical personnel, medical service provider, hospitals, clinics, care-givers and all other health institution across Africa.

As a developer, you can leverage on most of Manomite powerful micro services into your EMR Applications or any inline healthcare applications.

To travel to Manomite as a developer, you must have a Spaceship ðŸ˜œ Not really a NASA Spaceship. When I say Spaceship, it means you will need the Manomite Endpoints and your key to ship data and export data.

There is only one spaceship which serves every developer needs. Below is the endpoint.

```
https://api.manomite.net
```

Once you're **set** to drive the spaceship then you can commence to the next step.

What do I mean by the phrase **set.** It means you must have a secured development environment. If you are working from localhost, please install local SSL on your local development machine to avoid being blocked  by Manomite Sentinels.

Now lets dive in...
